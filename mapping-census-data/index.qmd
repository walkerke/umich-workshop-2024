## SSDAN webinar series

* Thurday, February 8: [Working with the 2022 American Community Survey with R and tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/umich-workshop-2024/acs-2022/)

* Thursday, February 22: [Analyzing 2020 Decennial US Census Data in R](https://walker-data.com/umich-workshop-2024/census-2020/)

* __Today: Doing "GIS" and making maps with US Census Data in R__

## Today's agenda

* Hour 1: How to get and explore spatial US Census data using R

* Hour 2: A tour of map types with R and US Census data

* Hour 3: Advanced workflows: automated mapping and spatial analysis

# US Census data: an overview

## R and RStudio

* R: programming language and software environment for data analysis (and wherever else your imagination can take you!)

* RStudio: integrated development environment (IDE) for R developed by [Posit](https://posit.co/)

* Posit Cloud: run RStudio with today's workshop pre-configured at <https://posit.cloud/content/7549022>

# Setup: RStudio and basic data structures in R

## The Decennial US Census

* Complete count of the US population mandated by Article 1, Sections 2 and 9 in the US Constitution

* Directed by the US Census Bureau (US Department of Commerce); conducted every 10 years since 1790

* Used for proportional representation / congressional redistricting

* Limited set of questions asked about race, ethnicity, age, sex, and housing tenure

## The American Community Survey

* Annual survey of 3.5 million US households 

* Covers topics not available in decennial US Census data (e.g. income, education, language, housing characteristics)

* Available as 1-year estimates (for geographies of population 65,000 and greater) and 5-year estimates (for geographies down to the block group)

* Data delivered as _estimates_ characterized by _margins of error_

## How to get Census data

* [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov) is the main, revamped interactive data portal for browsing and downloading Census datasets

* [The US Census **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface (API)](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) allows developers to access Census data resources programmatically

## tidycensus

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

* R interface to the Decennial Census, American Community Survey, Population Estimates Program, Migration Flows, and Public Use Microdata Series APIs

* First released in 2017; over 500,000 downloads from the Posit CRAN mirror

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

## tidycensus: key features

::: {.incremental}

- Wrangles Census data internally to return tidyverse-ready format (or traditional wide format if requested);

- __Automatically downloads and merges Census geometries to data for mapping__; 

- Includes a variety of analytic tools to support common Census workflows;

- States and counties can be requested by name (no more looking up FIPS codes!)
  
:::

## Getting started with tidycensus

* To get started, install the packages you'll need for today's workshop

* If you are using the Posit Cloud environment, these packages are already installed for you

```{r install-packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidycensus", "tidyverse", "mapview", "rdeck"))
```

## Optional: your Census API key

* tidycensus (and the Census API) can be used without an API key, but you will be limited to 500 queries per day

* Power users: visit <https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html> to request a key, then activate the key from the link in your email. 

* Once activated, use the `census_api_key()` function to set your key as an environment variable

```{r api-key, eval = FALSE}
library(tidycensus)

census_api_key("YOUR KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```

# Getting spatial US Census data

## Spatial Census data: the old way

Traditionally, getting "spatial" Census data required: 

::: {.incremental}

* Fetching shapefiles from the Census website;

* Downloading a CSV of data, then cleaning and formatting it;

* Loading geometries and data into your GIS of choice;

* Aligning key fields in your GIS and joining your data

:::


## Getting started with tidycensus

* Your core functions in tidycensus are `get_decennial()` for decennial Census data, and `get_acs()` for ACS data

* Required arguments are `geography` and `variables`

```{r decennial}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|3|4|5"

texas_income <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  state = "TX",
  year = 2022
)
```

---

* ACS data are returned with five columns: `GEOID`, `NAME`, `variable`, `estimate`, and `moe`

```{r view-decennial}
texas_income
```

## Spatial Census data with tidycensus

* Use the argument `geometry = TRUE` to get pre-joined geometry along with your data!

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|6"

texas_income_sf <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  state = "TX",
  year = 2022,
  geometry = TRUE
)
```

---

* We can now make a simple map with `plot()`: 

```{r}
plot(texas_income_sf['estimate'])
```


## Looking under the hood: _simple features_ in R

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/520851/34887433-ce1d130e-f7c6-11e7-83fc-d60ad4fae6bd.gif" style="width: 400px">

:::

::: {.column}

* The sf package implements a _simple features data model_ for vector spatial data in R

* Vector geometries: _points_, _lines_, and _polygons_ stored in a list-column of a data frame

:::

::::

---

* Spatial data are returned with five data columns: `GEOID`, `NAME`, `variable`, `estimate`, and `moe`, along with a `geometry` column representing the shapes of locations

```{r view-acs-1yr}
texas_income_sf
```

---

## Interactive viewing with `mapview()`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

<img src="https://github.com/tim-salabim/mvl/blob/cstriestohelp/imagery/animated/box_anim.gif?raw=true" style="width: 400px">

::: 

::: {.column}

* The __mapview__ package allows for interactive viewing of spatial data in R

```{r tx-mapview, eval = FALSE}
library(mapview)

mapview(
  texas_income_sf, 
  zcol = "estimate"
)
```

:::

::::

---

```{r tx-mapview-show, out.width = "850px", echo = FALSE}
library(mapview)

mapview(texas_income_sf, zcol = "estimate")
```


# Understanding geography and variables in tidycensus


## US Census Geography

![Source: US Census Bureau](img/census_diagram.png)


## Geography in tidycensus

* Information on available geographies, and how to specify them, can be found [in the tidycensus documentation](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#geography-in-tidycensus-1)

![](img/tidycensus_geographies.png){width=600}


## Searching for variables

* To search for variables, use the `load_variables()` function along with a year and dataset

* For the 2022 5-year ACS, use `"acs5"` for the Detailed Tables; `"acs5/profile"` for the Data Profile; `"acs5/subject"` for the Subject Tables; and `"acs5/cprofile"` for the Comparison Profile

* The `View()` function in RStudio allows for interactive browsing and filtering

```{r search-variables, eval = FALSE}
vars <- load_variables(2022, "acs5")

View(vars)

```

---

## Small-area spatial demographic data

* Smaller areas like Census tracts or block groups are available with `geography = "tract"` or `geography = "block group"`; one or more counties can optionally be specified to focus your query

```{r king-income}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|5,6"

nyc_income <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  state = "NY",
  county = c("New York", "Kings", "Queens",
             "Bronx", "Richmond"),
  year = 2022,
  geometry = TRUE
)

```

---

```{r}
mapview(nyc_income, zcol = "estimate")
```


---
class: middle, center, inverse

## Spatial data structure in tidycensus

---

## "Tidy" or long-form data

* The default data structure returned by __tidycensus__ is "tidy" or long-form data, with variables by geography stacked by row

* For spatial data, this means that geometries will also be stacked, which is helpful for group-wise analysis and visualization

---

## "Tidy" or long-form data

```{r tidy-data}
san_diego_race <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(
    Hispanic = "DP05_0073P",
    White = "DP05_0079P",
    Black = "DP05_0080P",
    Asian = "DP05_0082P"
  ),
  state = "CA",
  county = "San Diego",
  year = 2022,
  geometry = TRUE
)

```

---

```{r show-tidy-data}
san_diego_race
```


---

## "Wide" data 

* The argument `output = "wide"` spreads Census variables across the columns, returning one row per geographic unit and one column per variable

* This will be a more familiar data structure for traditional desktop GIS users

## "Wide" data

```{r wide-data}
#| code-line-numbers: "|12"

san_diego_race_wide <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(
    Hispanic = "DP05_0073P",
    White = "DP05_0079P",
    Black = "DP05_0080P",
    Asian = "DP05_0082P"
  ),
  state = "CA",
  county = "San Diego",
  geometry = TRUE,
  output = "wide",
  year = 2022
)
```


---

```{r show-wide-data}
san_diego_race_wide
```


---
class: middle, center, inverse

## Working with Census geometry

---

## Census geometry and the __tigris__ R package

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walkerke/tigris/master/tools/readme/tigris_sticker.png" style="width: 400px">

:::

::: {.column}

* tidycensus uses the __tigris__ R package internally to acquire Census shapefiles

* By default, the [Cartographic Boundary shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) are used, which are pre-clipped to the US shoreline

:::

::::

---

## Problem: interior water areas

* Let's re-visit the NYC income map

* Water areas throughout the city are included within tract polygons, making patterns difficult to observe for those who know the area

* `erase_water()` in the __tigris__ package offers a solution; it automates the removal of water areas from your shapes

* Tips: tune the `area_threshold` to selectively remove water area; use `cb = FALSE` to avoid sliver polygons

---

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|8"

nyc_income_tiger <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  state = "NY",
  county = c("New York", "Kings", "Queens",
             "Bronx", "Richmond"),
  year = 2022,
  cb = FALSE,
  geometry = TRUE
)
```
---

* `area_threshold = 0.5` means we are removing the largest 50% of water areas in the area 

```{r nyc-erase}
#| code-line-numbers: "|7"
#| message: false

library(tigris)
library(sf)
sf_use_s2(FALSE)

nyc_erase <- erase_water(
  nyc_income_tiger,
  area_threshold = 0.5,
  year = 2022
)

```

---

```{r}
mapview(nyc_erase, zcol = "estimate")
```

---


## Part 1 exercises

1. Use the `load_variables()` function to find a variable that interests you that we haven't used yet.  

2. Use `get_acs()` to fetch spatial ACS data on that variable for a geography and location of your choice, then use `mapview()` to display your data interactively.


# A tour of map types with R and US Census data


## Mapping in R

* R has a robust set of tools for cartographic visualization that make it a suitable alternative to desktop GIS software in many instances

* Popular packages for cartography include __ggplot2__, __tmap__, and __mapsf__

* Today, we'll be focusing on ggplot2; [see Chapter 6 of my book for similar examples using tmap](https://walker-data.com/census-r/)


## ggplot2 and `geom_sf()`

* ggplot2: R's most popular visualization package (over 137 million downloads!)

* ggplot2 graphics are defined by an _aesthetic mapping_ and one or more _geoms_

* `geom_sf()` is a special geom that interprets the geometry type of your spatial data and visualizes it accordingly

* As a result, we can make attractive maps using familiar ggplot2 syntax


# Mapping Census data with ggplot2


## Continuous choropleth

* By default, ggplot2 will apply a continuous color palette to create __choropleth__ maps

* Choropleth maps: the shading of a polygon / shape is mapped to a data attribute

---

```{r choro1}
library(tidyverse)

san_diego_asian <- filter(san_diego_race, variable == "Asian")

ggplot(san_diego_asian, aes(fill = estimate)) + 
  geom_sf()
```


## Continuous choropleth with styling

* We can apply some styling to customize our choropleth maps

* Used here: a [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) color palette, which is built-in to ggplot2

```{r choro2}
#| code-line-numbers: "|3|4|5-8"

cont_choro <- ggplot(san_diego_asian, aes(fill = estimate)) + 
  geom_sf() + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "rocket") + 
  labs(title = "Percent Asian by Census tract",
       subtitle = "San Diego County, CA",
       fill = "ACS estimate",
       caption = "2018-2022 ACS | tidycensus R package")
```

---

```{r}
cont_choro
```


---

## Classed choropleth

* We can also create a binned choropleth; ggplot2 will identify "pretty" breaks, or custom breaks can be supplied

```{r choro3}
#| code-line-numbers: "|4"

classed_choro <- ggplot(san_diego_asian, aes(fill = estimate)) + 
  geom_sf() + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option = "rocket", n.breaks = 6) + 
  labs(title = "Percent Asian by Census tract",
       subtitle = "San Diego County, CA",
       fill = "ACS estimate",
       caption = "2018-2022 ACS | tidycensus R package")
```

---

```{r choro3-show}
classed_choro
```


---

## Faceted choropleth maps

* Spatial ACS data in tidy (long) format can be _faceted_ by a grouping variable, allowing for comparative mapping

```{r facets}
#| code-line-numbers: "|5"

faceted_choro <- ggplot(san_diego_race, aes(fill = estimate)) + 
  geom_sf(color = NA) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "rocket") + 
  facet_wrap(~variable) + 
  labs(title = "Race / ethnicity by Census tract",
       subtitle = "San Diego County, California",
       fill = "ACS estimate (%)",
       caption = "2018-2022 ACS | tidycensus R package")
```

---

```{r facets-show, out.width = "850px", echo = FALSE}
faceted_choro
```


---
class: middle, center, inverse

## Mapping count data

---

## Mapping count data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

* At times, you'll want to show variations in _counts_ rather than rates on your maps of ACS data

* Choropleth maps are poorly suited for count data

* Let's grab some count data for race / ethnicity and consider some alternatives

:::

::: {.column}

```{r orange-race-counts}
#| code-line-numbers: "|3-8"

san_diego_race_counts <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(
    Hispanic = "DP05_0073",
    White = "DP05_0079",
    Black = "DP05_0080",
    Asian = "DP05_0082"
  ),
  state = "CA",
  county = "San Diego",
  geometry = TRUE,
  year = 2022
)
```

:::

::::

---

## Graduated symbol maps

* Graduated symbol maps show difference on a map with the size of symbols (often circles)

* They are better for count data than choropleth maps as the shapes are directly comparable (unlike differentially-sized polygons)

* We'll need to convert our data to _centroids_ to plot graduated symbols in ggplot2

---

```{r orange-race-centroids}
#| code-line-numbers: "|8"

library(sf)

san_diego_hispanic <- filter(
  san_diego_race_counts, 
  variable == "Hispanic"
)

centroids <- st_centroid(san_diego_hispanic)

```

## Graduated symbol maps

* We'll first plot a base layer of Census tracts, then a layer of graduated symbols on top

* Use `scale_size_area()` to plot _proportional symbols_

---

```{r plot-graduated}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|9"

grad_symbol <- ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = san_diego_hispanic, color = "black", fill = "lightgrey") + 
  geom_sf(data = centroids, aes(size = estimate),
          alpha = 0.7, color = "navy") + 
  theme_void() + 
  labs(title = "Hispanic population by Census tract",
       subtitle = "2018-2022 ACS, San Diego County, California",
       size = "ACS estimate") + 
  scale_size_area(max_size = 6) 
```

---

```{r}
grad_symbol
```


---

## Dot-density mapping

* It can be difficult to show _heterogeneity_ or _mixing_ of different categories on maps

* Dot-density maps scatter dots proportionally to data size; dots can be colored to show mixing of categories

* Traditionally, dot-density maps are slow to make in R; tidycensus's `as_dot_density()` function addresses this

## Dot-density mapping

```{r build-dots}
san_diego_race_dots <- as_dot_density(
  san_diego_race_counts,
  value = "estimate",
  values_per_dot = 200,
  group = "variable"
)
```

---

```{r show-dots}
san_diego_race_dots
```

## Dot-density mapping

* Like the graduated symbol map, we plot points over a base layer, but in this case with a much smaller size

* Use `override.aes` in `guide_legend()` to plot visible colors in the legend

```{r dot-plot}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|3|5"

dot_density_map <- ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = san_diego_hispanic, color = "lightgrey", fill = "white") + 
  geom_sf(data = san_diego_race_dots, aes(color = variable), size = 0.01) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3))) + 
  theme_void() + 
  labs(color = "Race / ethnicity",
       caption = "2018-2022 ACS | 1 dot = approximately 200 people")
```

---

```{r sd-dot-map}
dot_density_map
```

## Adding a basemap

* You may instead want a basemap as a reference layer; this is straightforward with the ggspatial package and `annotation_map_tile()`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|4"

library(ggspatial)

dot_density_with_basemap <- ggplot() + 
  annotation_map_tile(type = "cartolight", zoom = 9) + 
  geom_sf(data = san_diego_race_dots, aes(color = variable), size = 0.01) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3))) + 
  theme_void() + 
  labs(color = "Race / ethnicity",
       caption = "2018-2022 ACS | 1 dot = approximately 200 people")
```

---

```{r}
dot_density_with_basemap
```


---

## Customizing interactive maps with `mapview()`

* `mapview()` accepts custom color palettes and labels, making it a suitable engine for interactive maps for presentations!

```{r mapview-custom}
library(viridisLite)

colors <- rocket(n = 100)

mv1 <- mapview(san_diego_asian, zcol = "estimate", 
        layer.name = "Percent Asian<br>2018-2022 ACS",
        col.regions = colors)
```

---

```{r mapview-custom-show}
mv1
```

---

## Linked interactive maps with `mapview()`

* In mapview, layers can be stacked with the `+` operator or swiped between with the `|` operator

* __leafsync__ takes this one step further by creating side-by-side synced maps

---

```{r leafsync}
library(leafsync)

san_diego_white <- filter(san_diego_race, variable == "White")

m1 <- mapview(san_diego_asian, zcol = "estimate", 
        layer.name = "Percent Asian<br/>2018-2022 ACS",
        col.regions = colors)

m2 <- mapview(san_diego_white, zcol = "estimate", 
        layer.name = "Percent White<br/>2018-2022 ACS",
        col.regions = colors)

mv2 <- sync(m1, m2)
```

---

```{r}
mv2
```


# Bonus: migration flow mapping

## Getting migration flow data

* The `get_flows()` function obtains origin-destination flow data from the 5-year ACS

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

fulton_inflow <- get_flows(
  geography = "county",
  state = "GA",
  county = "Fulton",
  geometry = TRUE,
  year = 2020
) %>%
  filter(variable == "MOVEDIN") %>%
  na.omit()

fulton_top_origins <- fulton_inflow %>%
  slice_max(estimate, n = 30) 
```

## Mapping in 3D with rdeck!

```{r}
library(rdeck)

Sys.setenv("MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN" = "pk.eyJ1Ijoia3dhbGtlcnRjdSIsImEiOiJjbHRoYm12eDQwMzZ1MnNvN2JyMzZqYXBpIn0.Sdd16XvAh70IwBrqDD7MzQ")

fulton_top_origins$centroid1 <- st_transform(fulton_top_origins$centroid1, 4326)
fulton_top_origins$centroid2 <- st_transform(fulton_top_origins$centroid2, 4326)

flow_map <- rdeck(map_style = mapbox_light(), 
      initial_view_state = view_state(center = c(-98.422, 38.606), zoom = 3, 
                                      pitch = 45)) %>%
  add_arc_layer(get_source_position = centroid2,
          get_target_position = centroid1,
          data = as_tibble(fulton_top_origins),
          get_source_color = "#274f8f",
          get_target_color = "#274f8f",
          get_height = 1,
          get_width = scale_linear(estimate, range = 1:5),
          great_circle = TRUE
          )
```

---

```{r}
flow_map
```



## Part 2 exercises

* Try reproducing one of the maps you created in this section with a different state / county combination.  What patterns do you observe?

# Advanced workflows: automated mapping and small-area time series analysis

# Automated mapping

## Challenge: making 100 maps at once

Let's tackle a hypothetical example you might get at work.  Your boss has assigned you the following task: 

> I'd like you to look at geographic patterns in working from home for the 100 largest counties by population in the US.  Make me maps for each county.  

Related blog post: <https://walker-data.com/posts/iterative-mapping/>

__Warning__: may be too memory-intensive for Posit Cloud users

## Challenge: making 100 maps at once

At first, this may seem like a significant task!  You'll need to: 

::: {.incremental}

* Generate a list of the 100 largest counties by population in the US;

* Get data for those counties on working from home at a sufficiently granular geographic level to show patterns;

* Make and deliver 100 maps.

:::

## Step 1: find the 100 largest counties in the US by population

```{r}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)

top100counties <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "B01003_001",
  year = 2022,
  survey = "acs1"
) %>%
  slice_max(estimate, n = 100)
```

---

```{r}
top100counties
```

## Step 2: pull tract-level Census data by county

* We now need to organize tract data county-by-county using the information in the table.  But how can we do this efficiently?

* Something to remember (from [Downey, _Think Python_](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf): )

> Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly

* My preference for iteration in R: the __purrr__ package

## Step 2: pull tract-level data by county

* Here's how I'd do it: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

## What just happened?

::: {.incremental}

1. We _split_ our dataset of counties into separate datasets by `NAME` with `split()`

2. We used `map()` to set up iteration over _each_ county dataset

3. We extract the state and county FIPS codes for each of the top 100 counties

4. Finally, we call `get_acs()` using those state and county FIPS codes.  

This is why you want a Census API key!

:::

## Now, let's make some maps: 

* We can again use `map()` to... well... make some maps

```{r}
library(mapview)

wfh_maps <- map(wfh_tract_list, function(county) {
  mapview(
    county, 
    zcol = "estimate",
    layer.name = "% working from home"
  ) 
})
```

```{r}
wfh_maps$`San Mateo County, California`
```


# Small-area time-series analysis

## Prompt: analyzing change over time

Nice work!  Now, you have a new follow-up from your boss: 

> Interesting stuff.  However, I'm really interested in knowing how work-from-home is changing over time in our target markets.  Could you show me where work-from-home has increased the most in Salt Lake City?

## Time-series and the ACS: some notes

* 5-year ACS data represent _overlapping survey years_, meaning that direct comparison between overlapping datasets is not typically recommended

* The Census Bureau recommends comparing non-overlapping years in the 5-year ACS

* For 2018-2022 data, available 5-year intervals for comparison are 2008-2012 and 2013-2017

## The ACS Comparison Profile

* The Comparison Profile includes data on the current 5-year ACS and the 5-year ACS that ends 5 years prior to help with time-series comparisons  

```{r cp-tables}
utah_wfh_compare <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = c(
    income17 = "CP03_2017_024",
    income22 = "CP03_2022_024"
  ),
  state = "UT",
  year = 2022
)
```

---

```{r cp-tables-show}
utah_wfh_compare
```


## Geography and making comparisons

* Data in the Comparison Profile tables is only available down to the county level ([though counties can change from ACS to ACS!](https://walker-data.com/umich-workshop-2024/census-2020/#/caveat-changing-geographies))

* Comparing _neighborhood-level_ change across ACS datasets can introduce additional challenge as Census tract and block group boundaries may differ from previous years

---

## New boundaries drawn with the 2020 Cenus

* Locations with significant population growth (e.g. suburban Collin County, Texas) will have Census tracts / block groups with large populations subdivided in the 2020 Census

* Example: total population by Census tract in Collin County in the 2013-2017 ACS (on the left) and the 2018-2022 ACS (on the right)

```{r collin-compare, echo = FALSE}
library(patchwork)

ts_maps <- purrr::map_dfr(c(2017, 2022), ~{
  dat <- get_acs(
    geography = "tract",
    variables = "B01001_001",
    state = "TX",
    county = "Collin County",
    geometry = TRUE,
    year = .x
  ) %>%
    mutate(year = .x)
})

ggplot(ts_maps, aes(fill = estimate)) + 
  geom_sf(lwd = 0.1) + 
  theme_void(base_size = 18) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + 
  facet_wrap(~year)

```

## Discussion: interpolating data between different sets of Census geographies

---

## Data setup

* Let's grab data on the population working from home by Census tract in Salt Lake City

* Use a projected coordinate reference system to speed things up!

```{r get-wfh-data}
library(sf)

wfh_17 <- get_acs(geography = "tract", variables = "B08006_017", year = 2017,
                  state = "UT", county = "Salt Lake", geometry = TRUE) %>%
  st_transform(6620)

wfh_22 <- get_acs(geography = "tract", variables = "B08006_017", year = 2022,
                  state = "UT", county = "Salt Lake", geometry = TRUE) %>%
  st_transform(6620)
```

---

## Method 1: area-weighted interpolation

* _Interpolating_ data between sets of boundaries involves the use of _weights_ to re-distribute data from one geography to another

* A common method is _area-weighted interpolation_, which allocates information from one geography to another weighted by the area of overlap

* Typically more accurate when going _backward_, as many new tracts will "roll up" within parent tracts from a previous Census (though not always)

---

```{r areal-interpolate}
library(sf)

wfh_22_to_17 <- wfh_22 %>%
  select(estimate) %>%
  st_interpolate_aw(to = wfh_17, extensive = TRUE)
```


## Area-weighted interpolation

```{r map-aw}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"

library(mapview)
library(leafsync)

m20a <- mapview(wfh_22, zcol = "estimate", layer.name = "2020 geographies")
m15a <- mapview(wfh_22_to_17, zcol = "estimate", layer.name = "2015 geographies")

sync(m20a, m15a)
```


---

## Method 2: population-weighted interpolation

* If you need to go _forward_, area-weighted interpolation may be very inaccurate as it can incorrectly allocate large values to low-density / empty areas

* _Population-weighted interpolation_ will instead use an underlying dataset explaining the population distribution as weights

* Example: population-weighted interpolation using block population weights from the 2020 Census

---

## In tidycensus: `interpolate_pw()`

```{r pop-interpolate}
library(tigris)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

salt_lake_blocks <- blocks(
  "UT", 
  "Salt Lake", 
  year = 2020
)

wfh_17_to_22 <- interpolate_pw(
  from = wfh_17,
  to = wfh_22,
  to_id = "GEOID",
  weights = salt_lake_blocks,
  weight_column = "POP20",
  crs = 6620,
  extensive = TRUE
)
```

## Evaluating the result

```{r map-pw}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"

m17b <- mapview(wfh_17, zcol = "estimate", layer.name = "2017 geographies")
m22b <- mapview(wfh_17_to_22, zcol = "estimate", layer.name = "2022 geographies")

sync(m17b, m22b)
```

---

## Evaluating change over time

* With consistent geographies, we can now join 2017 and 2022 data and evaluate change over time

* [We covered this workflow in more detail in the February 22nd workshop](https://walker-data.com/umich-workshop-2024/census-2020/#/how-have-areas-changed-since-the-2010-census)

---

## Evaluating change over time

```{r}
wfh_shift <- wfh_17_to_22 %>%
  select(GEOID, estimate17 = estimate) %>%
  left_join(
    select(st_drop_geometry(wfh_22), 
           GEOID, estimate22 = estimate), by = "GEOID"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    shift = estimate22 - estimate17,
    pct_shift = 100 * (shift / estimate17)
  )
```

---

```{r}
mapview(wfh_shift, zcol = "shift")
```
