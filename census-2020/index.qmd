* RStudio: integrated development environment (IDE) for R developed by [Posit](https://posit.co/)

* Posit Cloud: run RStudio with today's workshop pre-configured at <https://posit.cloud/content/7549022>

## What is the decennial US Census?

* Complete count of the US population mandated by Article 1, Sections 2 and 9 in the US Constitution

* Directed by the US Census Bureau (US Department of Commerce); conducted every 10 years since 1790

* Used for proportional representation / congressional redistricting

* Limited set of questions asked about race, ethnicity, age, sex, and housing tenure

## The 2020 US Census: available datasets

Available datasets from the 2020 US Census include: 

::: {.incremental}

* The PL 94-171 Redistricting Data
* The Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) file
* The Demographic Profile (for pre-tabulated variables)
* Tabulations for the 118th Congress & for Island Areas
* The Detailed DHC-A file (with very detailed racial & ethnic categories)

:::

## How to get decennial Census data

* [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov) is the main, revamped interactive data portal for browsing and downloading Census datasets

* [The US Census **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface (API)](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) allows developers to access Census data resources programmatically

## tidycensus

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

* R interface to the Decennial Census, American Community Survey, Population Estimates Program, and Public Use Microdata Series APIs

* First released in 2017; nearly 500,000 downloads from the Posit CRAN mirror

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

::::

## tidycensus: key features

::: {.incremental}

- Wrangles Census data internally to return tidyverse-ready format (or traditional wide format if requested);

- Automatically downloads and merges Census geometries to data for mapping; 

- Includes a variety of analytic tools to support common Census workflows;

- States and counties can be requested by name (no more looking up FIPS codes!)
  
:::

## Getting started with tidycensus

* To get started, install the packages you'll need for today's workshop

* If you are using the Posit Cloud environment, these packages are already installed for you

```{r install-packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidycensus", "tidyverse", "mapview"))
```

## Optional: your Census API key

* tidycensus (and the Census API) can be used without an API key, but you will be limited to 500 queries per day

* Power users: visit <https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html> to request a key, then activate the key from the link in your email. 

* Once activated, use the `census_api_key()` function to set your key as an environment variable

```{r api-key, eval = FALSE}
library(tidycensus)

census_api_key("YOUR KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```

# Getting started with Census data in tidycensus


## 2020 Census data in tidycensus

* The `get_decennial()` function is used to acquire data from the decennial US Census

* The two required arguments are `geography` and `variables` for the functions to work; for 2020 Census data, use `year = 2020`.  

```{r decennial}
pop20 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state",
  variables = "P1_001N",
  year = 2020
)
```

---

* Decennial Census data are returned with four columns: `GEOID`, `NAME`, `variable`, and `value`

```{r view-decennial}
pop20
```

---

## Understanding the printed messages

* When we run `get_decennial()` for the 2020 Census for the first time, we see the following messages:

```
Getting data from the 2020 decennial Census
Using the PL 94-171 Redistricting Data summary file
Note: 2020 decennial Census data use differential privacy, a technique that
introduces errors into data to preserve respondent confidentiality.
ℹ Small counts should be interpreted with caution.
ℹ See https://www.census.gov/library/fact-sheets/2021/protecting-the-confidentiality-of-the-2020-census-redistricting-data.html for additional guidance.
This message is displayed once per session.
```

---

## Understanding the printed messages

* The Census Bureau is using _differential privacy_ in an attempt to preserve respondent confidentiality in the 2020 Census data, which is required under US Code Title 13

* Intentional errors are introduced into data, impacting the accuracy of small area counts (e.g. some blocks with children, but no adults)

* Advocates argue that differential privacy is necessary to satisfy Title 13 requirements given modern database reconstruction technologies; critics contend that the method makes data less useful with no tangible privacy benefit


## Requesting tables of variables

* The `table` parameter can be used to obtain all related variables in a "table" at once

```{r census-table}
#| code-line-numbers: "|3"

table_p2 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state", 
  table = "P2", 
  year = 2020
)
```

---

```{r view-table}
table_p2
```

---
class: middle, center, inverse

## Understanding geography and variables in tidycensus

---

## US Census Geography

![Source: US Census Bureau](img/census_diagram.png)

---

## Geography in tidycensus

* Information on available geographies, and how to specify them, can be found [in the tidycensus documentation](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#geography-in-tidycensus-1)

* The 2020 Census allows you to get data down to the Census block (unlike the ACS, covered last week)

![](img/tidycensus_geographies.png){width: 400}


---

## Querying by state

* For geographies available below the state level, the `state` parameter allows you to query data for a specific state

* __tidycensus__ translates state names and postal abbreviations internally, so you don't need to remember the FIPS codes!

* Example: total population in Texas by county

---

```{r query-by-state}
#| code-line-numbers: "|4"

tx_population <- get_decennial(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "P1_001N",
  state = "TX",
  sumfile = "dhc",
  year = 2020
)
```

---

```{r show-query-by-state}
tx_population
```

## Querying by state and county

* County names are also translated internally by __tidycensus__ for sub-county queries, e.g. for Census tracts, block groups, and blocks

```{r query-by-county}
#| code-line-numbers: "|5"

matagorda_blocks <- get_decennial(
  geography = "block",
  variables = "P1_001N",
  state = "TX",
  county = "Matagorda",
  sumfile = "dhc",
  year = 2020
)
```

---

```{r show-query-by-county}
matagorda_blocks
```


---

## Searching for variables

* To search for variables, use the `load_variables()` function along with a year and dataset

* The `View()` function in RStudio allows for interactive browsing and filtering

```{r search-variables, eval = FALSE}
vars <- load_variables(2020, "dhc")

View(vars)

```

## Available decennial Census datasets in tidycensus

The different datasets in the 2020 Census are accessible by specifying a `sumfile` in `get_decennial()`.  The datasets we'll cover today include: 

::: {.incremental}

* The DHC data (`sumfile = "dhc"`)
* The Demographic Profile (`sumfile = "dp"`)
* The CD118 data (`sumfile = "cd118`)
* The Detailed DHC-A data (`sumfile = "ddhca"`)

:::


# Data structure in tidycensus


## "Tidy" or long-form data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

* The default data structure returned by __tidycensus__ is "tidy" or long-form data, with variables by geography stacked by row

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}


```{r tidy-data}
single_year_age <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state",
  table = "PCT12",
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "dhc"
)

```

:::

::::

---

```{r show-tidy-data}
single_year_age
```



## "Wide" data 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

* The argument `output = "wide"` spreads Census variables across the columns, returning one row per geographic unit and one column per variable

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r wide-data}
#| code-line-numbers: "|6"

single_year_age_wide <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state",
  table = "PCT12",
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "dhc",
  output = "wide" 
)
```

:::

::::


---

```{r show-wide-data}
single_year_age_wide
```



## Using named vectors of variables


* Census variables can be hard to remember; using a named vector to request variables will replace the Census IDs with a custom input

* In long form, these custom inputs will populate the `variable` column; in wide form, they will replace the column names

---

```{r named-variables}
#| code-line-numbers: "|4|5"

ca_samesex <- get_decennial(
  geography = "county",
  state = "CA",
  variables = c(married = "DP1_0116P",
                partnered = "DP1_0118P"),
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "dp",
  output = "wide"
)
```


---

```{r show-named-variables}
ca_samesex
```


---

## Part 1 exercises

1. Use `load_variables(2020, "dhc")` to find a variable that interests you from the Demographic and Housing Characteristics file.

2. Use `get_decennial()` to fetch data on that variable from the decennial US Census for counties in a state of your choosing.

# Part 2: Analysis workflows with 2020 Census data

## The tidyverse

```{r tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)

tidyverse_logo()
```

* The [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/index.html): an integrated set of packages developed primarily by Hadley Wickham and the Posit team

## tidycensus and the tidyverse

* Census data are commonly used in _wide_ format, with categories spread across the columns

* tidyverse tools work better with [data that are in "tidy", or _long_ format](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf); this format is returned by tidycensus by default

* Goal: return data "ready to go" for use with tidyverse tools

# Exploring 2020 Census data with tidyverse tools

## Finding the largest values

* dplyr's `arrange()` function sorts data based on values in one or more columns, and `filter()` helps you query data based on column values

* Example: what are the largest and smallest counties in Texas by population?

```{r texas-population}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)

tx_population <- get_decennial(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "P1_001N",
  year = 2020,
  state = "TX",
  sumfile = "dhc"
)

```

---

```{r sort-ascending}
arrange(tx_population, value)

```

---

```{r sort-descending}
arrange(tx_population, desc(value))
```

---

## What are the counties with a population below 1,000?

* The `filter()` function subsets data according to a specified condition, much like a SQL query

```{r filter-below-1000}
below1000 <- filter(tx_population, value < 1000)

below1000
```

## Using summary variables

* Many decennial Census and ACS variables are organized in tables in which the first variable represents a _summary variable_, or denominator for the others

* The parameter `summary_var` can be used to generate a new column in long-form data for a requested denominator, which works well for normalizing estimates

## Using summary variables

```{r summary-variable}
#| code-line-numbers: "|13|15"

race_vars <- c(
  Hispanic = "P5_010N",
  White = "P5_003N",
  Black = "P5_004N",
  Native = "P5_005N",
  Asian = "P5_006N",
  HIPI = "P5_007N"
)

cd_race <- get_decennial(
  geography = "congressional district",
  variables = race_vars,
  summary_var = "P5_001N", 
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "cd118"
)
```

---

```{r view-summary-variable}
cd_race
```

---

## Normalizing columns with `mutate()`

* dplyr's `mutate()` function is used to calculate new columns in your data; the `select()` column can keep or drop columns by name

* In a tidyverse workflow, these steps are commonly linked using the pipe operator (`%>%`) from the magrittr package

```{r mutate-and-select}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|3"

cd_race_percent <- cd_race %>%
  mutate(percent = 100 * (value / summary_value)) %>% 
  select(NAME, variable, percent) 
```


---

```{r view-percent}
cd_race_percent
```

---
class: middle, center, inverse

## Group-wise Census data analysis

---

## Group-wise Census data analysis

* The `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions in dplyr are used to implement the split-apply-combine method of data analysis

* The default "tidy" format returned by tidycensus is designed to work well with group-wise Census data analysis workflows

---

## What is the largest group by congressional district?

```{r largest-group}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|3"

largest_group <- cd_race_percent %>%
  group_by(NAME) %>% 
  filter(percent == max(percent)) 

# Optionally, use `.by`: 
# largest_group <- cd_race_percent %>%
#   filter(percent == max(percent), .by = NAME) 
```

---

```{r view-largest-group}
largest_group
```

---

## What are the median percentages by group?

```{r median-by-group}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|3"

cd_race_percent %>%
  group_by(variable) %>% 
  summarize(median_pct = median(percent, na.rm = TRUE)) 
```


# Exploring maps of Census data

## "Spatial" Census data

* One of the best features of tidycensus is the argument `geometry = TRUE`, which gets you the correct Census geometries with no hassle

* `get_decennial()` with `geometry = TRUE` returns a _spatial_ Census dataset containing _simple feature geometries_; learn more on March 7

* Let's take a look at some examples

## "Spatial" Census data

* `geometry = TRUE` does the hard work for you of acquiring and pre-joining spatial Census data

* Consider using the Demographic Profile for pre-tabulated percentages

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|7"

iowa_over_65 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "DP1_0024P",
  state = "IA",
  geometry = TRUE,
  sumfile = "dp",
  year = 2020
)

```

---

* We get back a _simple features data frame_ (more about this on March 7)

```{r}
iowa_over_65
```

## Exploring spatial data

* Mapping, GIS, and spatial data is the subject of our March 7 workshop - so be sure to check that out!

* Even before we dive deeper into spatial data, it is _very_ useful to be able to explore your results on an interactive map

* Our solution: `mapview()`

## Exploring spatial data

```{r}
library(mapview)

mapview(iowa_over_65)
```

## Creating a shaded map with `zcol`

```{r}
mapview(iowa_over_65, zcol = "value")
```

## Customizing your mapview output

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2"

mapview(iowa_over_65, zcol = "value",
        layer.name = "% age 65 and up<br>Census tracts in Iowa")

```


## Customizing your mapview output

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|5"

library(viridisLite)

mapview(iowa_over_65, zcol = "value",
        layer.name = "% age 65 and up<br>Census tracts in Iowa",
        col.regions = inferno(100))
```


## Saving and using interactive maps

Use the `saveWidget()` function over the `map` slot of your mapview map to save out a standalone HTML file, which you can embed in websites

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(htmlwidgets)

m1 <- mapview(iowa_over_65, zcol = "value",
        layer.name = "% age 65 and up<br>Census tracts in Iowa",
        col.regions = inferno(100))

saveWidget(m1@map, "iowa_over_65.html")

```


## Part 2 exercise

* Try making an interactive map of a different variable from the Demographic Profile (use `load_variables(2020, "dp")` to look them up) for a different state, or state / county combination.  

# Part 3: The Detailed DHC-A File and time-series analysis

# The 2020 Decennial Census Detailed DHC-A File

## The Detailed DHC-A File

* Tabulation of 2020 Decennial Census results for population by sex and age

* Key feature: break-outs for thousands of racial and ethnic groups

## Limitations of the DDHC-A File

* An "adaptive design" is used, meaning that data for different groups / geographies may be found in different tables

* There is considerable sparsity in the data, especially when going down to the Census tract level
  
## Using the DDHC-A File in tidycensus

* You'll query the DDHC-A file with the argument `sumfile = "ddhca"` in `get_decennial()`

* A new argument, `pop_group`, is required to use the DDHC-A; it takes a population group code. 

* Use `pop_group = "all"` to query for all groups; set `pop_group_label = TRUE` to return the label for the population group

* Look up variables with `load_variables(2020, "ddhca")`

## Example usage of the DDHC-A File

```{r ddhca-example}
#| code-line-numbers: "|3|6|7|8"

mn_population_groups <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state",
  variables = "T01001_001N",
  state = "MN",
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "ddhca",
  pop_group = "all",
  pop_group_label = TRUE
)

```

---

```{r}
mn_population_groups
```



## Looking up group codes

* A new function, `get_pop_groups()`, helps you look up population group codes

* It works for SF2/SF4 in 2000 and SF2 in 2010 as well!

```{r}
available_groups <- get_pop_groups(2020, "ddhca")
```

## Understanding sparsity in the DDHC-A File

* The DDHC-A File uses an "adaptive design" that makes certain tables available for specific geographies

![](img/adaptive_design.png){width=800}

## You may see this error...

```{r}
#| error: true

get_decennial(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "T02001_001N",
  state = "MN",
  county = "Hennepin",
  pop_group = "1325",
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "ddhca"
)
```


## How to check for data availability

* A new function, `check_ddhca_groups()`, can be used to see which tables to use for the data you want

```{r}
check_ddhca_groups(
  geography = "county", 
  pop_group = "1325", 
  state = "MN", 
  county = "Hennepin"
)
```

## Mapping DDHC-A data

* Given data sparsity in the DDHC-A data, should you make maps with it?

* I'm not personally a fan of mapping data that are geographically sparse. But...

::: {.incremental}
* I think it is OK to map DDHC-A data if you think through the data limitations in your map design
:::

## Example: Somali populations by Census tract in Minneapolis

```{r}
library(tidycensus)

hennepin_somali <- get_decennial(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "T01001_001N",
  state = "MN",
  county = "Hennepin",
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "ddhca",
  pop_group = "1325",
  pop_group_label = TRUE,
  geometry = TRUE
)

```

---

```{r}
mapview(hennepin_somali, zcol = "value")
```

## Alternative approach: dot-density mapping

* I don't think choropleth maps are advisable with geographically incomplete data in most cases

* Other map types - like graduated symbols or dot-density maps - may be more appropriate

* The tidycensus function `as_dot_density()` allows you to specify the number of people represented in each dot, which means you can represent data-suppressed areas as 0 more confidently

---

```{r}
somali_dots <- as_dot_density(
  hennepin_somali,
  value = "value",
  values_per_dot = 25
)

mapview(somali_dots, cex = 0.01, layer.name = "Somali population<br>1 dot = 25 people",
        col.regions = "navy", color = "navy")
```

# Time-series analysis

## How have areas changed since the 2010 Census?

* A common use-case for the 2020 decennial Census data is to assess change over time

* For example: which areas have experienced the most population growth, and which have experienced the steepest declines?

* __tidycensus__ allows users to access the 2000 and 2010 decennial Census data for comparison, though variable IDs will differ

---

## Getting data from the 2010 Census

```{r get-2010-data}
#| code-line-numbers: "|3|4|5"

county_pop_10 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "P001001", 
  year = 2010,
  sumfile = "sf1"
)

```

---

```{r}
county_pop_10
```

---

## Cleanup before joining

* The `select()` function can both subset datasets by column and rename columns, "cleaning up" a dataset before joining to another dataset

```{r clean-2010-data}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2"

county_pop_10_clean <- county_pop_10 %>%
  select(GEOID, value10 = value) 

county_pop_10_clean
```

---

## Joining data

* In __dplyr__, joins are implemented with the `*_join()` family of functions

```{r join-data}
county_pop_20 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "P1_001N",
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "dhc"
) %>%
  select(GEOID, NAME, value20 = value)

county_joined <- county_pop_20 %>%
  left_join(county_pop_10_clean, by = "GEOID") 
```

---

```{r show-joined-data}
county_joined
```


---

## Calculating change

* __dplyr__'s `mutate()` function can be used to calculate new columns, allowing for assessment of change over time

```{r calculate-change}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2,3,4,5"

county_change <- county_joined %>%
  mutate( 
    total_change = value20 - value10, 
    percent_change = 100 * (total_change / value10) 
  ) 

```

---

```{r show-change}
county_change
```


---

## Caveat: changing geographies!

* County names and boundaries can change from year to year, introducing potential problems in time-series analysis

* This is particularly acute for small geographies like Census tracts & block groups, which we'll cover on March 7!

---

```{r show-unmatched-areas}
filter(county_change, is.na(value10))
```
